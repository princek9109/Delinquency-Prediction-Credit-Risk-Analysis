# Delinquency-Prediction-Credit-Risk-Analysis
This project, "AI-Powered Collections Strategy," is a predictive modeling solution designed to analyze and mitigate credit delinquency risk. It involves developing an interactive system to forecast customer behavior, enabling targeted and effective debt management.



## Project Deliverables

* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: A comprehensive analysis to understand the dataset, identify key patterns, and prepare the data for modeling.
* **Predictive Model Plan**: A plan outlining the chosen machine learning model (Logistic Regression), the justification for the choice, and the evaluation strategy.
* **PowerPoint Presentation**: A presentation summarizing the project's key findings, the proposed solution, and the expected business impact of implementing an AI-powered collections strategy.

## Key Insights and Findings

* **Missing Data**: Identified and handled missing values in key financial fields like `Income` and `Loan_Balance`.
* **Risk Indicators**: Found that customers with a high `Credit_Utilization` and multiple `Missed_Payments` have an increased probability of delinquency.
* **Model Justification**: Chose a Logistic Regression model for its high interpretability, which is crucial for building trust and transparency in financial applications.
* **Expected Business Impact**: The proposed solution is expected to achieve a **15% reduction** in 30+ day delinquency for high-risk customers within the first 6 months and **automate 60%** of routine outreach tasks.
